# doubleshot
I wrote this two line script in preparation for the a certain pen-testin course, to create good screenshot logging. 
I needed my screenshots to be saved to the picture folder - in order to attach as raw picture.
I also wanted to be able to clip part of the picture - in order to paste in a Cherry Tree report.
Therefore - Doubleshot.
What it would do is first take a screenshot and save to file (in your "Pictures folder).
Than it will prompt you to select a part of the screen and it will be in your clipboard to paste in a report.


Here is how to set it up (this is for Kali linux, with gnome - adjust as needed):
1. First install gnome-screenshot.
2. Download the script and place it an folder 
3. Allow excusion with :"chmod +x doubleshot.sh"
4. Go to your settings (Top right downward arrow, and click the wrench and screwdriver).
5. Select Devices > Keyboard.
6. Go all the way to the buttom and create a new shortcut.
7. In the command you will put the full path to the script, like i.e :"/root/scripts/doubleshot/doubleshot.sh"
8. Assign a key. you can replace the default printscreen by disabling the original printscreen and than using it in the one created.
